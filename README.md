# NYC Motor Collision Analysis

## Overview:
New York City is a sprawling metropolis comprising five boroughs and houses approximately 8.2 million individuals.

Given its dense population and bustling traffic, it's unsurprising that the city sees a significant number of accidents every year, each with its unique circumstances. Committed to fostering transparency and public engagement, the NYPD compiles data for every accident, making it accessible to the public via nycopendata.socrata.com.

## Dataset:
This comprehensive crash data analysis aims to unearth underlying patterns or correlations that could provide insights into the prevalent collision rates. The dataset spans from 2012 to 2019 and contains close to 1.6M+ observations.

* Accident Data: Comprehensive records capturing the specifics of each incident.
* Accident Time: Timestamps that help gauge peak accident intervals and chronological trends.
* Borough and Zip Code: These offer insights into which areas and neighborhoods are particularly accident-prone.
* Contributing Factor Vehicle: Key reasons leading to the accidents.
* Off Street Name & On Street Name: Detailed locational data to determine exact sites of collisions.
* Longitudes & Latitude: Geographic coordinates to map out accident hotspots visually.
* Number of People Killed and Injured: Breakdown by category, including cyclists, motorcyclists, vehicle occupants, and pedestrians.

## Tasks:
* The data was extracted from "nycopendata.com" using Open Data API (OData API) and performed Data Connection with Tableau.
* The data was cleaned using Python and stored in Google Cloud Storage as a Bucket to create a virtual instance.
* I performed analysis using Google's Big Query in Google Cloud Platform and stored the query results in CSV files.
